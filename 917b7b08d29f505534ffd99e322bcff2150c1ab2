To show the expanded list of code owners the frontend could simply refetch the complete list of code owners without specifying a limit (while we have no paging).\n\nThe frontend could also implement this without this change, e.g. by always fetching one result more than needed, so I would be also fine with dropping this change.\n\nLet\u0027s asked the frontend team, what they think?
