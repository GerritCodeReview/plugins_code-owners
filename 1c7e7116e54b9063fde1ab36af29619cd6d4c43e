      "message": "Do we have a way to dry-run test this? For example: Are there API endpoints we could use to validate all OWNERS files in the largest repo and see how long those take if carried out in sequence?\n\nI am a bit worried that we are creating a bottleneck that affects endpoints that might not anticipate the newly added extra work (e.g. when I create a new branch and point that to an existing commit, I\u0027d expect this to be super fast since I really just add a pointer to an existing commit).\n\nWould it be an option to separate this behavior into an API endpoint? So we allow interested callers to check config validity of a new branch a-priori and others to proceed as usual?",
