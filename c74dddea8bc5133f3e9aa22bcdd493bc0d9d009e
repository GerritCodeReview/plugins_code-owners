      "message": "LGTM for the code added in this change. Left few comments.\n\nGeneral comment: the code added here is duplicating the logic we have in PatchListCache. In the new diff cache, rename detection is part of the diff cache key [1] (right now the score is static, but it\u0027s easy to expose more methods in the interface to request a specific rename score or disable).\n\nAlso code owners (at least in this change) only cares about old path, new path, change type. I could also add another field in new diff cache key to prune, e.g. computing rebase edits. These should make the computations much faster. Benefits would be:\n1) Not duplicating code.\n2) Benefiting from the results being cached, instead of recomputing diff entries with every request.\n\n[1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/+/36271eb7a4e4cf238480158f9b08383b5e038959/java/com/google/gerrit/server/patch/DiffOperationsImpl.java#245",
