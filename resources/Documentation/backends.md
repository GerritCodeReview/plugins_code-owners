# @PLUGIN@ - Backends

The following code owner backends are supported:

* `find-owners`:
   Code owner backend that supports the syntax of the
   [find-owners](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/admin/repos/plugins/find-owners)
   plugin.
* `proto`:
   Code owner backend that supports a proto-based syntax. The proto syntax is
   not final yet and backwards incompatible changes are likely to happen. This
   is why this backend is experimental for now and should not be used in
   production.
