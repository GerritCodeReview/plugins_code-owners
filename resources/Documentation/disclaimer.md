# Disclaimer

The @PLUGIN@  plugin is specifically developed to support code owners for the
Chrome and Android teams at Google. This means some of the functionality and
design decisons are driven by Google-specific use-cases. Nonetheless the support
for code owners is pretty generic and [configurable](config.html) so that it
should be suitable for other teams as well.
