The @PLUGIN@ plugin provides support for defining code owners for files in a
repository.

If the @PLUGIN@ plugin is enabled, changes can only be submitted if all
touched files are covered by approvals from code owners.

# Alternatives

Similar functionality is provided by the find-owners plugin and the owners
plugin.
