# @PLUGIN@ - Configuration

The global configuration of the @PLUGIN@ plugin is stored in the `gerrit.config`
file in the `plugin.@PLUGIN@` subsection.

In addition some configuration can be done on the project level in
`@PLUGIN@.config` files that are stored in the `refs/meta/config` branches of
the projects.

Parameters that are not set for a project are inherited from the parent project.

# <a id="globalConfiguration">Global configuration in gerrit.config</a>

<a id="pluginCodeOwnersBackend">plugin.@PLUGIN@.backend</a>
:       The code owners backend that should be used.\
        Can be overridden per project by setting
        [codeOwners.backend](#codeOwnersBackend) in
        `@PLUGIN@.config`.\
        The supported code owner backends are listed at the
        [Backends](backends.html) page.\

        change.\
        The required approval must be specified in the format

        The configured label must exist for all projects for which this setting
        applies (all projects that have code owners enabled and for which this
        setting is not overridden).\
        Can be overridden per project by setting
        [codeOwners.requiredApproval](#codeOwnersRequiredApproval) in

        The supported code owner backends are listed at the
        [Backends](backends.html) page.\
