# Config Guide

The `@PLUGIN@` plugin has many configuration parameters that can be used to
customize its behavior. These configuration parameters are described in the
[config](config.html) documentation. This guide gives some additional
recommendations for the configuration, but doesn't cover all configuration
parameters.

## <a id="requiredConfiguration">Required Configuration

**Before** installing/enabling the plugin, or enabling the code owners
functionality for further projects, it is important to do some basic
configuration. This includes choosing a [code owner backend](backends.html),
defining the approvals that count as code owner approval and as code owner
override, opting-out projects or branches and configuring the allowed email
domain. All this configuration is covered in detail by the [setup
guide](setup-guide.html).
