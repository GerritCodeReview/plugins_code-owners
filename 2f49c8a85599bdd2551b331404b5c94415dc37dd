      "message": "No, being a global code owner is different.\nA global code owner can approve any change.\nThis means if the bot is a global code owner it would need to self-approve the own changes, but Android wants to disallow self-approvals and then this wouldn\u0027t work.\n\nWhat has been discussed as alternative is to support controlling with permissions who is allowed to self approve a label, e.g. for Code-Review disallow self-approvals for normal users, but allow self-approvals for bots. Implementing this would be much more work which is why we agreed on supporting to exempt users instead (more details in b/181028278).",
