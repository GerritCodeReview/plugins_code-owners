      "message": "Yeah, I also find \"....\" hard to read, that\u0027s why I added a comment here.\n\nFor SimplePathExpressionMatcher \"...\" is the equivalent of \"**\" in globs, both match any string, including slashes (see [1]). This means the equivalent of \"**.md\" is \"....md\" (\u0027**\u0027 replaced with \"...\"). Also see the examples in the table at [1]. I\u0027m not a fan of this syntax, but that\u0027s what we use internally. I also clarified with the Piper team that \"....\u003cfile-type\u003e\" is really read as \"...\" (matches any string, including slashes), followed by \u0027.\u003cfile-type\u003e\u0027, rather than \".\" followed by \"...\" (matches any string, including slashes) and followed by \"\u003cfile-type\u003e\".\n\nAnything I can do to make this clearer?\n\n[1] https://gerrit.googlesource.com/plugins/code-owners/+/refs/heads/master/resources/Documentation/path-expressions.md#simple-path-expressions",
