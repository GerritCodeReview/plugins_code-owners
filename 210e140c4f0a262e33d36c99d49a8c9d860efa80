      "message": "This is covered by the test that is newly added in this change. Without this line the test would be flaky.\n\nWhen the test list code owners with limit\u003d2 it expects 2 results (l. 1061), the user that was explicitly set as code owner + 1 random user. Without this line here, the random user could be the same user as the user that was explicitly set as code owner. Since codeOwners is a Set, they would be de-duped and we would return only 1 result. So the assertion that expects 2 results would fail.\n\nAt the moment I can\u0027t think of any other test for this.",
