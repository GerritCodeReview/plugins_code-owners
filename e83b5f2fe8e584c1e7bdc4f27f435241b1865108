I just was told that this was an issue with the checks plugin. Hence we follow the example of the checks plugin to avoid this issue. AFAIK nothing has changed which would have made this issue go away. I guess Alice knows more.\n\n\u003e If that\u0027s a cheap early return, we could always request it?\n\nIf the plugin is not loaded yet, the core frontend doesn\u0027t know that such a plugin option exists and hence it cannot request it.\n\nOn server side we don\u0027t want to return this info for all change requests, because computing the file statuses is rather expensive and many callers will not need this info.",

If we built it as a revision endpoint, there\u0027d be no races. There is also a complexity cost involved here: With the current implementation, one has to know, read or otherwise find out that there might be races.
