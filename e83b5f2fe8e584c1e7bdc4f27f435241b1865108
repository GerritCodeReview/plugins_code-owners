      "message": "I think it would be better to just follow the established practice of making this a per-patch set endpoint to avoid the race.\n\nThis way, we are forcing callers to send a second request if they detect a race and to detect a race in the first place. If we built it as a revision endpoint, there\u0027d be no races. There is also a complexity cost involved here: With the current implementation, one has to know, read or otherwise find out that there might be races. For your UI, that might be OK, but for robot callers that others write, this presents a trap that is too easy to fall into.",
