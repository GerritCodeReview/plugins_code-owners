Alternatively we may add a checkState call in the beginning of CodeOwnerApprovalCheck#getPathCodeOwnerStatus to check that reviewerAccountIds is empty when checkAllOwners is true, so that we fail if this condition is violated. I think I have no preference for either of these options.\n\n\u003e Tempted to refactor a bit but can delay to a follow-up change to keep\n\u003e this contained.\n\nIf you see an opportunity to refactor this is a follow-up change, please do. I agree that this refactoring is not required for this change and it\u0027s better to do this as a follow-up.",
