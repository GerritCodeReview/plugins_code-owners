      "message": "The code looks fine, but I would like to understand the UX implications. Maybe we are showing OWNER icons too often and too many?\n\nWhat happens if I own all files and my reviewers also own all files in the change. Do we all see two icons in every row? If that was the Gerrit frontend team, then maybe that would be slightly annoying?\n\nMaybe just one icon somewhere saying \"you own all files in this change\" would be cool? Or only showing the icon for files that not yet approved?\n\nAre all these scenarios written down somewhere? Do we have any metrics for understanding this better?\n\nFeel free to close this as \"was already discussed with Delphine, I am just implementing a reviewed design\", but I wanted to voice my concern, because I think the Code Owners feature has the danger of creating sub-optimal user experiences, because the Gerrit team itself is not using it day to day.",

Is the status then always APPROVED?\n\nAlso from a UX point of view it would be nice to just have one icon per row and only one column, so we don\u0027t overload the user and clutter the UI.",

While for the author case you only need to show one, for the reviewer case we need to possibly show 2. One whether they own a file, one to see if it\u0027s already been approved.
