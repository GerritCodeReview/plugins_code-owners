That\u0027s actually also an issue with the configuration that we already have in the existing code. I\u0027ve made a separate change to fix this [1]. If this looks good, I will rebase this change on top of it.\n\n\u003e For project.config you could install a hook\nYes, I will do this in a later change.\n\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/code-owners/+/275714",
