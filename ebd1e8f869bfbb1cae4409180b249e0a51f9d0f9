So maybe let\u0027s do this only when we hit this flakiness?\n\n\u003e Alternatively/additionally, we can add more users.\n\nThis is what patch set 2 did, and I believe it already made the flakiness unlikely enough.\n\n\u003e Optionally, should we try running it internally 100 times, and see that it always succeeds?\n\nGood idea. Done by running:\n\n$ for i in {1..100} ; do echo \" $i \"; echo \u0027{}\u0027 | bazel test //plugins/code-owners/javatests/com/google/gerrit/plugins/codeowners/acceptance/api:GetCodeOwnerBranchConfigIT --cache_test_results\u003dNO \u003e\u003e out.txt ; done\n\nAll test runs succeeded.",
