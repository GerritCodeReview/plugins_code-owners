      "message": "Thanks, actually it\u0027s intended that the links go to .html and not .md.\n\nHow this works is that on access of an .html file the corresponding .md file is parsed and rendered as HTML. E.g. https://android-review.googlesource.com/plugins/code-owners/Documentation/about.html works, although the source file is about.md and not about.html.\n\nWe prefer using the HTML files since they are independent of the doc format that is used in the source.\n\nFWIW this is consistent with the Gerrit core the documentation that is also served as HTML files (the Gerrit core documentation is written in Asciidoc, but since we are serving it as HTML files, we could easily switch to Markdown one day without breaking links).",

      "message": "Right, this is a problem when you are looking at the documentation in a source browser like Gitiles. The links only work when the documentation is hosted inside a Gerrit server that knows how to do the rendering.\n\nSimilarly links to the Gerrit core documentation that appear in the code-owners documentation cannot be resolved if the documentation is viewed in Gitiles, as these are relative links that only work when the documentation is hosted in Gerrit, where the Gerrit core documentation is present as well.\n\nTo avoid trouble with broken links please prefer viewing the documentation at a place where it\u0027s hosted in Gerrit, e.g. at https://android-review.googlesource.com/plugins/code-owners/Documentation/index.html",
