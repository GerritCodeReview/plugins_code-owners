      "message": "The frontend may already depend on this, but in principle we could still change it. I would not like to name it \"disabled\" though, as then we cannot add further fields to CodeOwnersStatusInfo which are not related to disabling (e.g. I considered to include a list of branches that do not contain any code owner configs). If you have another proposal for a better name, please let me know. In any case, renaming this should be a separate change (hence resolving this here for this change).",
